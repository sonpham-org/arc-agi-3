## [1.2.2] — UI: Move agent transport controls above Intervene button
*Author: Claude Sonnet 4.6 | 2026-03-12*

### Changed
- **`templates/index.html`** — Swapped the vertical order of the agent transport bar (Autoplay / Undo / Restart) and the "Intervene as Human" controls. The transport bar now appears directly below the game canvas (where Intervene was), so agent start controls are visible without scrolling. Intervene sits below it.

## [1.2.1] — Senior Audit of Phase 1 Modularization
*Author: Claude Opus 4.6 (audit) | 2026-03-12*

### Context
Independent senior audit of the `refactor/phase-1-modularization` branch (56 commits, 145 files, +30k/-14k lines) prior to opening PR against `master`. Audit conducted by a different author to catch issues missed during development.

### Bugs Found & Fixed

**Python (3 issues):**
- **Broken import in `agent_scaffold.py:28`** — `_PLANNER_SYSTEM_PROMPT` was renamed to `_PLANNER_SYSTEM_PROMPT_TEMPLATE` during the refactor but this import was never updated. Would crash at runtime on any code path that imports `agent_scaffold` (batch runner, CLI agent). Fixed by updating the import.
- **`server/app.py` not directly executable** — Running `python server/app.py` failed with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'models'` because the project root wasn't on `sys.path` when executed from the `server/` subdirectory. Fixed by adding `sys.path.insert(0, str(_ROOT))` after `_ROOT` is computed.
- **Dead backup file committed** — `server/app.py.backup` (836 lines, the original `server.py`) was tracked in git. Removed.

**JavaScript (7 issues — app completely broken in browser):**
- **`redrawGrid` function dropped** — Existed in master's `ui.js`, removed during Phase 24 split but never added to `ui-grid.js`. Caused immediate crash on page load. Restored to `ui-grid.js`.
- **Duplicate `let currentUser`** — Declared in both `state.js:20` and `session.js:23`. This `SyntaxError` prevented `session.js` from parsing at all, which cascaded into: `updateEmptyAppState` undefined, `initApp` never called, no games loaded, no session tabs. Removed duplicate from `session.js`.
- **`_PROMPT_SECTION_MAP` dropped** — Was in master's `session.js`, removed during split, never added to `session-views.js` where `_getPromptSections()` uses it. Restored to `session-views.js`.
- **3 split modules never added to template** — `session-storage.js`, `session-replay.js`, `session-persistence.js` were created on disk (Phase 9) but never added to `templates/index.html`. Meanwhile `session.js` was slimmed expecting them to be loaded. Added script tags in correct load order.
- **Duplicate declarations across split files** — `session-replay.js` re-declared `_liveScrubMode`, `_liveScrubViewIdx`, `_liveScrubLiveGrid` (already in `state.js`) and `turnstileVerified` (already in `session-persistence.js`). Removed duplicates.
- **`renderSessionTabs()` and `getTabDotClass()` dropped** — Were in master's `session.js`, removed during split, put in no file. Called 20+ times across the codebase. Restored to `session.js`.

### Fixed
- `CLAUDE.md` — updated two stale references from `server.py` to `server/state.py` for `HIDDEN_GAMES` list location

### Audit Summary
- **Test results:** 278 passed, 40 skipped, 0 failed
- **All module imports:** 37/37 pass (including `agent_scaffold` after fix)
- **Architecture grade:** 8/10 — service layer, DB split, and agent decomposition are well-executed
- **Remaining warnings (non-blocking):** `SYSTEM_MSG` duplication in `constants.py` and `models.py`; `FEATURES` dict duplicated in `server/state.py` and `server/helpers.py`; non-refactor work (ws03/ws04 games, Codex integration) mixed into refactor branch; chaotic phase numbering in commit history

- `server/state.py`, `server/helpers.py` — shared request/session state extracted from app
- `tests/test_prompt_builder.py`, `tests/test_llm_providers.py`, `tests/test_db.py`, `tests/test_exceptions.py`, `tests/test_bot_protection.py`, `tests/test_services.py` — 283 passing unit tests (0 failures)
- `docs/modularization/module-map.md` — complete module reference for all Python and JS modules
- `AGENTS.md` — codebase structure guide for AI agents

### Fixed
- Session persistence bugs 1, 2, 4 (undo durability, atomic DB writes, dedup via `_action_dict_from_row`)
- LM Studio timeout: `scaffolding.js` 1500ms→15000ms, `llm_providers.py` 90s→180s; `LOCAL_MODEL_TIMEOUT` env var added
- `get_current_user()` gap: was in `server.py` but missing from `server/helpers.py` — would have caused `NameError` at runtime

## [1.0.2] — feature/lmstudio-support
*Author: Mark Barney + Cascade (Claude Opus 4.6 Thinking) | 2026-03-10*

### Fixed
- **"No API key for LM Studio" error** (`scaffolding.js`) — LM Studio is a local program, not a cloud API. It doesn't need an API key. But `_callLLMInner` has a key gate that all non-Puter providers must pass. The LM Studio call block was positioned after this gate with no key set, so every LLM call threw immediately. Fix: `loadModels()` now sets a dummy key (`'local-no-key-needed'`) in localStorage when LM Studio models are discovered (both server-side and client-side paths). The key gate passes, the LM Studio block ignores the key and uses `baseUrl` from localStorage instead. No restructuring of provider routing needed.
- **CORS blocking all LM Studio calls** (`scaffolding.js`, `server.py`) — LM Studio does NOT send `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` headers. Every browser fetch to `localhost:1234` — both discovery AND chat completions — was blocked by CORS policy. Discovery was already fixed by server-side probing in staging mode. LLM calls now route through `/api/llm/lmstudio-proxy` on our Flask server, which forwards to `localhost:1234` server-to-server (no CORS). Same pattern as the existing Cloudflare Workers AI proxy (`/api/llm/cf-proxy`). Custom base URLs (Cloudflare Tunnel) are passed through.
- **LM Studio 400 Bad Request on system-only messages** (`scaffolding.js`) — LM Studio Jinja templates require at least one `user` message. The scaffold orchestrator sends `[{role:'system', content:...}]` only, which LM Studio rejects with `"No user query found in messages"`. Fix: LM Studio branch in `_callLLMInner` now promotes the system message to user role when no user message is present. Same pattern as the existing Gemini branch.
- **LM Studio proxy swallowing error details** (`server.py`) — `/api/llm/lmstudio-proxy` used `raise_for_status()` which replaced the actual LM Studio error body with a generic httpx exception string. Fix: proxy now forwards the actual response body and status code from LM Studio, so the client sees the real error message.

## [1.0.1] — feature/lmstudio-support
*Author: Mark Barney + Cascade (Claude Opus 4.6 Thinking) | 2026-03-10*

### Added
- **LM Studio provider** (`scaffolding.js`, `ui.js`, `models.py`, `server.py`) — users can now run inference against locally loaded LM Studio models directly from the web UI. Browser calls `localhost:1234/v1/chat/completions` directly; Railway server is never involved in the call path.
- **`LMSTUDIO_CAPABILITIES` lookup table** (`models.py`) — known capability overrides (reasoning, image) keyed on `api_model` ID. Used by both CLI (`agent.py`) and browser discovery paths.
- **`docs/lmstudio-integration.md`** — developer notes capturing every integration pitfall hit during implementation.
- **`docs/2026-03-10-lmstudio-discovery-plan.md`** — architecture plan for completing client-side discovery (pending).
- **`coding-standards.md`** — Mark's coding standards, now tracked in repo.
- **`AGENTS.md`** — agent-specific coding instructions incorporating all standards.

### Fixed
- `reasoning_content` fallback in `_callLLMInner` (`scaffolding.js`) — GLM-series models return thinking tokens in `reasoning_content`; `content` comes back `null`. Blind `content || ''` read produced empty output. Fixed to `content || reasoning_content || ''`.
- LM Studio models not appearing in model selector dropdown (`scaffolding.js`) — `'Lmstudio'` was missing from `providerOrder`; all discovered models were silently dropped.
- Duplicate model entries in dropdown (`server.py`) — static registry entries and dynamic discovery both produced entries for the same `api_model`, showing every model twice. Dynamic entries now skip any `api_model` already in the static registry. Static LM Studio entries subsequently removed entirely (see below).
- Embedding models appearing in chat model selector (`server.py`) — `text-embedding-*` models filtered out of dynamic discovery results.
- Wrong image capability on `qwen3.5-35b-a3b` (`models.py`, `server.py`) — model has confirmed vision encoder (mmproj, from load logs) but was marked `image: False`. Corrected to `True`.
- Misleading CORS error message (`scaffolding.js`) — told users to enable CORS when LM Studio 0.3+ has it on by default. Updated to direct users to check model load state instead.

### Removed
- Static LM Studio model registry entries (`models.py`) — `lmstudio-qwen3.5-35b`, `lmstudio-glm-4.7-flash`, `lmstudio-glm-4.6v-flash` were hardcoded for one developer's machine. Removed in favour of pure dynamic discovery so any model a user has loaded appears automatically.

### Completed (plan execution by Cascade, using Claude Opus 4.6 Thinking)
- **Server-side LM Studio discovery removed** from `server.py` — port 1234 removed from `LOCAL_PORTS`; `is_lmstudio` branching and `LMSTUDIO_CAPABILITIES` server-side lookup cleaned up. Ports 8080/8000 retained for other local servers.
- **Browser-side LM Studio discovery finalized** in `scaffolding.js` `loadModels()` — fetches `{baseUrl}/v1/models` directly from browser with 1.5s timeout, filters embedding models, annotates capabilities from `LMSTUDIO_CAPABILITIES`, merges into `modelsData`. Dead dedup code removed.
- **File headers added** to all edited files (`scaffolding.js`, `ui.js`, `server.py`, `models.py`) per `coding-standards.md`.
- **`docs/lmstudio-integration.md` rewritten** — architecture section now documents client-side discovery flow; pitfalls #3, #6, #7 updated to reference correct files; testing section replaced with browser-based verification; client↔server communication analysis and next-developer notes added.
- **`CHANGELOG.md` created and maintained** (this file) — was missing, now tracks all changes.
- **Dead `LMSTUDIO_CAPABILITIES` import removed** from `server.py` — no longer used after server-side discovery removal. Comment added explaining it lives in `models.py` for CLI agent path only.
- **Hybrid discovery strategy implemented** — LM Studio does NOT send CORS headers by default, so browser-only discovery fails silently. Fix: server-side discovery restored for staging mode (server is local, no CORS needed); client-side discovery kept for production (Railway, requires user to enable CORS in LM Studio). Client-side dedup prevents doubles when both paths find models. Console warning added for CORS/network failures to aid debugging. New pitfall documented in `docs/lmstudio-integration.md`.

## [1.0.0] — master baseline
*2026-03-10*

Initial versioned baseline. Captures the state of `master` at the time `CHANGELOG.md` was introduced. All prior work is recorded in git history.
